## :bulb: Concept
During these two weeks the most important thing for me is learning about teh Javascript library *D3.js* and getting used to work with it. Despite my lack of experience and knowledge about D3.js, I still managed to work something out.

I made a data visualisation using D3.js. I've made a simple bar chart where you can filter between three different types of data. When the user clicks on a filter, the bar chart wil change the data using a nice transition.      
filter options:
- total amount of streams per artist
- total amount of different listeners per artist 
- The average amount of streams per listener per artist 

When the user hover over a rectangle, the browser will tel the user what the exact output of the X axis and the Y axis is.
